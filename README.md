# Blothead
Better `<head>` elements to optimize the SEO for your [Blot](https://blot.im) template.

## Background
After using blot for many years it is finally time to contribute. As the basic SEO in the templates is limited, this is an addition that *may* help increase your Blot instance's rankings and visibility.

*Heavily inspired by Josh Buchea's [ðŸ¤¯ HEAD](https://htmlhead.dev/).*
